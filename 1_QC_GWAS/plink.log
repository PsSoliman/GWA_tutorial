Reading map (extended format) from [ HapMap_3_r3_5.bim ] 
1430443 markers to be included from [ HapMap_3_r3_5.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ HapMap_3_r3_5.fam ] 
165 individuals read from [ HapMap_3_r3_5.fam ] 
112 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
56 cases, 56 controls and 53 missing
80 males, 85 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading genotype bitfile from [ HapMap_3_r3_5.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 1430443 SNPs
112 founders and 53 non-founders found
179 heterozygous haploid genotypes; set to missing
Writing list of heterozygous haploid genotypes to [ plink.hh ]
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0.997899
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 1430443 SNPs
After filtering, 56 cases, 56 controls and 53 missing
After filtering, 80 males, 85 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
